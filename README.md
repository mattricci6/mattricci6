# Matt Ricci

Avionics Firmware Lead @ RMIT HIVE | BE, BS (expected Nov. 2025)

Firmware developer of [Australis avionics](https://github.com/RMIT-Competition-Rocketry/Australis-Avionics-firmware)

Maintainer of GitHub org for [RMIT Competition Rocketry](https://github.com/RMIT-Competition-Rocketry)

## About Me
I'm an enthusiastic student in computer engineering, passionate about computer architecture, embedded systems programming, and RTL design. I have experience developing firmware for student rocket avionics using FreeRTOS on ARM-based targets, with skills in both hardware and software domains.

I have spent the past two years participating in RMIT University's efforts to restart its involvement in competition rocketry, helping build the foundation of the new team in 2024 as firmware lead for the avionics subsystem and continuing this role in 2025 for our participation in the **International Rocket Engineering Competition** (IREC).
